# Wix Events API Spike Artifacts

**Status:** ✅ Spike Complete - Integration Working
**Branch:** `temp/arch-spike-wix-sdk-auth`
**Date:** August 2025

## Purpose

This directory contains working code artifacts from the Wix Events API integration spike. These files demonstrate the complete solution but are **temporary** - they will be replaced by proper production code integrated into the main application architecture.

## Files

### Core Implementation
- **`wix-oauth-implementation.ts`** - Working OAuth 2.0 implementation with proper error handling
- **`test-complete-minimal-event.ts`** - Validated event creation test (creates real events)

### Infrastructure
- **`cloudflare-worker-webhook.js`** - Deployed Cloudflare Worker for webhook endpoint
- **`wix-webhook-server.ts`** - Local Node.js webhook server (reference implementation)
- **`decode-webhook-jwt.ts`** - Utility for extracting instance ID from webhook JWT

## Validation Status

All files are **tested and working**:
- ✅ OAuth authentication succeeds (4-hour tokens)
- ✅ Event creation succeeds (multiple events created)
- ✅ Webhook captures real instance ID
- ✅ Complete error handling implemented

## Production Integration Path

When integrating into production:

1. **OAuth logic** → Move to `src/adapters/wix.ts`
2. **Event creation** → Integrate with main event model in `src/core/`
3. **Webhook handling** → Move to proper webhook infrastructure
4. **Environment config** → Integrate with main configuration system
5. **Error handling** → Integrate with main error handling patterns

## Reference Documentation

- **Implementation Guide:** `docs/WIX-EVENTS-API-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`
- **Lessons Learned:** `docs/WIX-EVENTS-API-LESSONS-LEARNED.md`
- **Spike Overview:** `docs/SPIKES.md` (Spike 2B section)

## Cleanup

These files should be **deleted** once production implementation is complete and validated. They serve as:
- Reference for production implementation
- Backup of working spike solution
- Documentation of exact approach that worked

**⚠️ Important:** These are spike artifacts, not production code. Use as reference for proper integration into main application architecture.
